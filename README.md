sharebox
===

* Share a _live-editing_ textbox with others.
* _Drag'n'drop_ file sharing powered by Dropzone.js.
* Instant uploaded image previews. To make it more awesome, you can even take a photo directly from your iPhone. (Tap on the 'Sharebox' title on iPhone)
* Built with Ruby and JavaScript.
* TODO: uploaded files are now stored directly in memory, should use Tempfile.

###Setup:
Simply run:

```
$ ruby sharebox.rb 2345
```

Then visit `http://localhost:2345/` or `http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:2345/` on your browser.
